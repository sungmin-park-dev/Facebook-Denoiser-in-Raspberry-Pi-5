# Task A: Real-time Audio Pipeline - Completion Report

## 📅 Completed: 2025-10-23

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

- ✅ Implement 4-stage filter chain for tactical audio
- ✅ Achieve RTF < 0.1 on Raspberry Pi 5
- ✅ Support flexible audio devices (H08A, Bluetooth, USB)
- ✅ Real-time processing with buffered streaming
- ⚠️ Gunfire suppression (requires model retraining)

---

## 📊 **Final Performance**

### **Raspberry Pi 5 (Real-time)**
```
Model: Light-32-Depth4 (Valentini 60ep)
RTF: 0.092 (Target < 0.1 ✅)
Latency: ~2 seconds (buffer-based streaming)
Voice Quality: Excellent (STOI 0.926, PESQ 2.30)
Background Noise Removal: Good
Gunfire Suppression: Limited (model limitation)
```

### **MacBook Pro (Offline Processing)**
```
Processing: Real-time capable
.wav file support: Yes
Batch processing: Supported
```

---

## 🎛️ **Final Configuration**

### **Production Config: AI Denoiser Only**
```yaml
# audio_pipeline/configs/filter_chain.yaml
filters:
  ai_denoiser:
    enabled: true
    model_path: models/current/best.th  # Light-32-Depth4
```

**Rationale:**
- Best voice quality preservation
- Lowest RTF (0.071)
- Simple and predictable
- Other filters (HPF, Impulse, Limiter) had minimal effect

---

## 🧪 **Testing Summary**

### **Tested Configurations:**
1. ✅ **AI Only** - Best overall (adopted)
2. ⚠️ **HPF + AI + Limiter** - Similar to AI only
3. ⚠️ **Impulse Suppressor** - Caused voice distortion
4. ❌ **Band-pass (300-3400Hz)** - Removed voice fundamentals
5. ❌ **GunfireSuppressor** - Minimal effect on gunfire
   - Gentle/Default > Aggressive (less voice distortion)
   - Over-aggressive settings hurt voice quality

### **Test Environments:**
- Office (low noise): Excellent
- Tactical audio samples (gunfire, helicopter, drone): Voice preserved, gunfire remains

---

## 📁 **Deliverables**

### **Scripts**
- `audio_pipeline/scripts/run_pipeline.py` - Real-time processing
- `process_audio.py` - Offline .wav file processing
- `process_all_samples.sh` - Batch processing

### **Configurations**
- `filter_chain.yaml` - Production (AI only)
- `filter_chain_simple.yaml` - Backup
- `filter_chain_optimized.yaml` - Alternative

### **Usage Examples**

**Real-time (Raspberry Pi 5):**
```bash
cd /home/test1/denoiser
source /home/test1/venv/bin/activate
python audio_pipeline/scripts/run_pipeline.py

# List devices
python audio_pipeline/scripts/run_pipeline.py --list-devices

# Manual device selection
python audio_pipeline/scripts/run_pipeline.py --device 1
```

**Offline (Mac):**
```bash
conda activate denoiser_modern
python process_audio.py input.wav output.wav

# Batch process all samples
./process_all_samples.sh
```

## 🔍 **Lessons Learned**

### **What Worked:**
1. ✅ AI Denoiser (Light-32) performs excellently for voice
2. ✅ Buffered streaming eliminates audio dropouts
3. ✅ Multi-threaded processing enables smooth real-time operation
4. ✅ Modular filter architecture allows easy experimentation

### **What Didn't Work:**
1. ❌ Impulse Suppressor caused voice distortion (too aggressive)
2. ❌ Band-pass filtering removed voice fundamentals
3. ❌ GunfireSuppressor had minimal effect on gunfire
4. ❌ Simple threshold-based detection cannot distinguish gunfire from voice

### **Why Gunfire Suppression Failed:**
- Gunfire characteristics (impulse + echo + low-freq explosion) overlap with voice
- Time-domain features (duration, amplitude) are insufficient
- **Solution:** Requires AI model trained on tactical audio datasets

---

## 🚀 **Future Work**

### **Priority 1: Model Retraining (Planned)**
- Dataset: Valentini + Tactical audio (gunfire, explosions, helicopter)
- Expected: Voice quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐ + Gunfire suppression ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Time: 2-3 days (Colab GPU)

### **Priority 2: Additional Features**
- Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
- Echo cancellation
- Adaptive noise gate

## 🏆 **Conclusion**

Task A successfully implemented a real-time audio pipeline with excellent voice quality (RTF 0.092, STOI 0.926). While gunfire suppression requires model retraining, the modular architecture and comprehensive testing provide a solid foundation for future enhancements.

**Status:** ✅ Complete (with known limitations)
**Next:** Task B - WiFi Direct Communication between RP5 units
