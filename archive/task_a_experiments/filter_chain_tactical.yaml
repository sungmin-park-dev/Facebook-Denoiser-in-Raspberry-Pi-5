# TACTICAL CONFIG - Gunfire/Explosion Suppression
# =================================================
# Designed to remove gunfire, explosions, and impulse noise
# while preserving human voice

audio:
  sample_rate: 16000
  chunk_size: 1024
  channels: 1
  format: float32

filters:
  # Stage 1: Band-pass Filter (VOICE RANGE ONLY)
  # Preserve 300Hz - 3400Hz (voice fundamental + harmonics)
  # Remove low-freq explosions and high-freq gunfire cracks
  highpass:
    enabled: true
    cutoff_freq: 300      # Remove low-freq explosions
    order: 4

  # Stage 2: AGGRESSIVE Impulse Suppressor
  # Target short-duration, high-amplitude signals (gunfire)
  impulse_suppressor:
    enabled: true
    threshold_factor: 2.0   # Very aggressive (was 10.0)
    window_size: 10         # Longer window for stability

  # Stage 3: AI Denoiser
  # Remove continuous background noise
  ai_denoiser:
    enabled: true
    model_path: null
    device: cpu

  # Stage 4: Soft Limiter
  # Prevent any remaining impulses from passing through
  limiter:
    enabled: true
    threshold: 0.5          # Much lower threshold (was 0.95)
    ratio: 10.0
